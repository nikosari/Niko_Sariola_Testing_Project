## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Depending on the scale of the company you test for, many of the different free tools available online will be good enough. Just need to find the right one for your job.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Robot Framework seems to be the most commonly used framework, and I'd also use scripting languages such as python or typescript. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
-  Ability to develop automated tests, building test environments, test integration, performance monitoring, documentation, experience in developing UI, knowledge of Python/JavaScript, API knowledge, CI/CD and DevOps practices, knowledge in frameworks. 



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Further expertise in scripting languages, better understanding of CI/CD practices and knowledge in the required frameworks. I would also need to be more familiar with different test environments. Advanced version control is also something that is always required.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think this project helped me more than any theory during the course. At first I was a little confused by the structure of the instructions, they felt very unclear to me. But once I understood what I had to do, it was pretty straightforward.
